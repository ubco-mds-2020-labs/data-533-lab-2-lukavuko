# DATA 533: Collaborative Software Development

# Assignment 2

## Objective
1. Learning the fundamental Python modules and packages
2. Understanding how to create modules and packages in Python
3. Understanding how to build a package in collaboration with a version control tool 

## Overall goal
In this lab, you will work collaboratively in a group of two to develop a Python package. Your package could contain functions that are entirely new to the Python ecosystem, improve upon pre-existing functions or re-implement existing code/functions that you wish to deepen your understanding of (e.g., a linear regression package from scratch).

## Step 1: Group formation
Students are required to work in a group for this lab. Please form a group (maximum two students) and upload the group information to Canvas by November 25, 2020 at 8.00pm. 

## Step 2: Package topic selection (4 marks)
Each group is required to select a topic (i.e., a set of functions) to develop the package. Students need to write a brief description of the package and functions (max 1000 characters, with spaces) that they are planning to implement and upload it to Canvas by November 27, 2020 at 8.00 pm.

## Step 3: Working on the Package (16 marks)
Now it's time to start developing the package. Specific expectations for this step are:
- Set-up an appropriate directory structure (file and folder organization) for your package [2 marks].
- Use Python to write the package that contains at least four useful functions. These are the functions you proposed in the previous step. [8 marks].
    - Create a package with two subpackages. Each subpackage must have at least two modules and each module should have at least three methods/functions. Each member of the group is expected to do one of the subpackages. 
    - One module must use inheritance.
    - The person who did not write a particular subpackage must write the documentation for the package as well as create a test Python file demonstrating how to use the package.
- Write a .md file explaining the function details and how they work. Create a test Python file demonstrating how to use the package [2 marks].
- Use version control features to collaborate with your team members. Have a Git history to demonstrates that the group members contributed equally [4 marks]. 

## Submission instructions: 

Please upload the following information (one submission from a group is good enough)
- Step 1: Directly write the information in Canvas lab 2.
- Step 2: Upload a PDF file. Please include both students' information in the file. 
- Step 3: Submit the GitHub classroom link.
